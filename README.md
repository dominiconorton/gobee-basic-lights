# GoBee - Expressive Non-Verbal Robot Communication

![GoBee Logo](https://v0-go-bee-nxsvxo.vercel.app/static/media/logo.5bb3b58e.svg)

GoBee is an open-source project that specializes in creating expressive non-verbal robots through multi-sensory AI models. The platform enables machines to communicate through sound, movement, and light, similar to how characters like R2D2, Wall-E, and Luxo Jr. express themselves.

## 🌟 Features

- **Light-Based Communication**: Generate expressive light sequences that convey meaning and emotion
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages GPT-4 to translate text into meaningful light patterns
- **Interactive Demo**: Experience non-verbal communication through an interactive firefly visualization
- **Multi-Sensory Output**: Designed to support sound and movement in addition to light patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gobee.git
   cd gobee
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 💡 How It Works

GoBee translates text input into expressive light sequences using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The system:

1. Takes user text input
2. Sends it to the OpenAI API with a specialized prompt
3. Receives a structured JSON response with light sequence instructions
4. Renders the sequence using animated fireflies on a canvas

The light sequences are designed to convey meaning and emotion through patterns of light and color, similar to how humans use non-verbal cues in communication.

## 🔧 Project Structure

- `index.js` - Backend server with OpenAI API integration
- `public/` - Frontend assets
  - `index.html` - Main HTML file
  - `script.js` - Frontend JavaScript with animation and API interaction
  - `styles.css` - Styling for the application

## 🌐 Deployment

### Backend Deployment

The backend can be deployed to various platforms:

- **Heroku**: Create a new app and connect your GitHub repository
- **Railway**: Import your repository and set environment variables
- **Vercel**: Configure as a serverless function

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend can be deployed to:

- **Netlify**: Connect your repository and set build settings
- **Vercel**: Import your repository for automatic deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Configure GitHub Actions for deployment

## 🔍 Research & Approach

GoBee's research focuses on creating AI systems that communicate through non-verbal cues. Our approach includes:

- **Sound**: Generating contextual sounds that convey meaning without words
- **Movement**: Training machines to use physical gestures and movements
- **Light**: Using patterns of light and color to communicate status and mood
